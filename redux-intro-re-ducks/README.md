# Redux Intro refactored for Re-Ducks modular approach

The application is a React Counter component. This was based off the great Redux intro tutorial by Dave Ceddia:
Blog for Redux Intro tutorial - [https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/](https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/)
Repo for Redux Intro tutorial - [https://github.com/dceddia/redux-intro](https://github.com/dceddia/redux-intro)

This refactor was to take Dave's tutorial and apply the Re-ducks modular approach. I heavily used James Hegedus's Re-ducks example repo:
