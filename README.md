# Redux Intro with different approaches

The application is a React Counter component. This was based off the great Redux intro tutorial by Dave Ceddia:

Blog for Redux Intro tutorial - [https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/](https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/)

Repo for Redux Intro tutorial - [https://github.com/dceddia/redux-intro](https://github.com/dceddia/redux-intro)

There are two projects, one for the base original tutorial and another for a refactor to learn how to implement the re-ducks modular approach.
