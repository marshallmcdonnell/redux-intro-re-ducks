# Redux Intro with a Re-Ducks modular approach included

The application is a React Counter component. This was based off the great Redux intro tutorial by Dave Ceddia:
Blog for Redux Intro tutorial - [https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/](https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/)
Repo for Redux Intro tutorial - [https://github.com/dceddia/redux-intro](https://github.com/dceddia/redux-intro)

There are two projects, one for the base original tutorial and another for a refactor to learn how to implement the re-ducks modular approach.

Original: `redux-intro`
Re-ducks: `redux-intro-re-ducks`
